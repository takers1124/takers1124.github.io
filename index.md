## Professional 

### What I do (present)

I am currently working as an [ORISE](https://orise.orau.gov/) Post-Master's Fellow with the USDA Forest Service at the [Rocky Mountain Research Station](https://research.fs.usda.gov/rmrs).
My current research project will create spatial data resouces to help guide forest managers when planning for conifer cone collection as part of the [reforestation pipeline](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/forests-and-global-change/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2021.629198/full).   

### What I did (past)

I started my career studying molecular biology at UC Santa Cruz and worked as an undergraduate in Al Zahler's lab on a project with Matt Ragle studying [gene regulation](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/7/982.short).
I enjoyed the research in itself, but after graduating decided that I wanted to learn more about the world in a broader way and figure out my place in it.
I traveled for a couple of years, working odd jobs, and then started [teaching English in Spain](https://conversaspain.com/auxiliares-de-conversacion/) where I lived for 3.5 years.
Pandemic and etc brought me home to California and while taking care of family, I completed a Master's of Science at CSU, Sacramento in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology.
For my thesis research, I studied the impact of fuel management treatments (prescribed fire and mechanical thnning) on soil fungal diversity in a mixed coniferous forest.

### What I want to do (future)

While none of us know what the future holds, I am keeping my options open and trying to remain flexible and hopeful for a more inclusive and supportive world.
That being said, I will go where there is opportunity for me to continue with open science.
That may be pursuing a PhD, or it may be working in land management, or it may be both with a roundabout path between.
No matter what chapter is next, I hope to continue developing new skills while making a positive impact on the world. 

## Personal

### Fun facts / interests 

I am interested in all sorts of hobbies (writing, reading, crafting, mushroom cultivation, aquariums, vermicomposting) and activities (hiking, biking, gardening).
What I am focusing on at this stage in life is to finish projects that I have started and be content with routine (which means saying no sometimes and striving for balance between what is new and old).
