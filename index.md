# About Me

## Professional 

### What I do (now)

I am currently working as an ORISE Post-Master's Fellow with the USDA Forest Service at the Rocky Mountain Research Station.
My current research project will create spatial data resouces to help guide forest managers when planning for conifer cone collection.   

### What I did (past)

I started my career studying molecular biology at UC Santa Cruz and worked as an undergraduate in Al Zahler's lab on a project studying gene regulation.
I enjoyed the research in itself, but after graduating decided that I wanted to learn more about the world in a broader way and figure out my place in it.
I traveled for a couple of years, working odd jobs, and then started teaching English in Spain where I lived for 3.5 years.
Pandemic and etc brought me home to California and while taking care of family, I completed a Master's of Science at CSU, Sacramento in Ecology, Evolutiona and Conservation Biology.
For my thesis research, I studied the impact of fuel management treatments (prescribed fire and mechanical thnning) on soil fungal diversity in a mixed coniferous forest.

### What I want to do (future)

While none of us know what the future holds, I am keeping my options open and trying to remain flexible and hopeful for a more inclusive and supportive world.
That being said, I will go where there is opportunity for me to continue with open science.
That may be pursuing a PhD, or it may be working in land management, or it may be both with a roundabout path between.

## Personal

### Fun facts / interests 

I am interested in all sorts of hobbies (writing, reading, crafting, mushroom cultivation, aquariums, vermicomposting) and activities (hiking, biking, gardening).
What I am focusing on at this stage in life is to finish projects that I have started and be content with the routines (which means saying no sometimes and striving for balance between what is new and old).
